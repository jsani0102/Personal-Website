Personal Website
====================
A website that aggregates my online presence. It is also a place where I can showcase my projects, resume, blog, and personality.

Feel free to [take a look](http://jayantsani.com).

The website is still very much in progress, as I am just starting out with web development and design. Eventually, I will learn a backend framework such as Node.js or Ruby on Rails in order to host my blog on my personal site instead of on Medium. I also coded all of the HTML and CSS, with no help from frameworks or even Haml/SASS. I am in the process of learning JavaScript to leverage frontend frameworks such as Angular.js.
